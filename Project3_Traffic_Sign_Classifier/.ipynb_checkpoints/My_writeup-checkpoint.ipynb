    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to use grayscale image because this can reduce the dimension of feature space, and thus reduce computation time and help overcome overfitting, and yet grayscale images preserve enough information to be recognized (human eye can recognize grayscale traffic signs). Note that my conversion of RGB to grayscale is configurable in function LeNet_modified(x, n_channels, keep_prob) by specifying n_channels=1 (use original RGB if n_channels is set to 3)\n",

    "Here is the example traffic sign images (same samples as above) in grayscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "![my grayscale image][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data by subtracting each pixel value by 128 and then dividing by 128, this is to center the input data around zero mean and range -1 to 1, in order to help numerical optimization in gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't generate additional data since the accuracy was good enough to meet the requirement. I could use data augmentation such as slight rotation, mirroring, or adding slight noise to the images.\n",

Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "My model was modified from LeNet, which is a relatively shallow CNN model that primarily includes 2 convolution layers and 3 fully connected layers. Traffic signs involve intrinsically spatial features, which justifies the choice of using convolution layers. Given that the dimension of the input image is not big (32 X 32), this shallow architecture should be enough to achieve high accuracy. During the initial training, i found high accuracy on trainning set while relative low on validation set, which indicates overfitting. I then chose to add two drop out layers to force more neurons to learn the features and these drop out layers helped.\n",
